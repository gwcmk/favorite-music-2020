      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2020</h1>

        Once quarantine started, I found myself often dreaming about the past. People from middle school and high school
        who I haven’t spoken to in years kept reappearing in my dreams. I still haven’t really figured out exactly why
        this is happening, but looking back on my music listening habits this year gives me some clues. In spite of
        having more time than ever, I spent the least time in years seeking out new music. Instead, I went back to my
        roots and listened to many of my favorites of the past. There’s something safe and comforting about falling back
        on the things that I know. With that in mind, I considered not making this list at all, but I’ve spent the past
        couple days going through my saved music from 2020 and think it’s still worth putting it together.

        I’m much more lacking than usual in new and upcoming artists, but I still kept up with many of my favorites, who
        put out a bunch of great music this year. This year saw hyperpop reach new levels of popularity (finally getting
        an actual name for the genre), and although I haven’t kept up with everything, it continued to be some of my
        favorite new music. Mainstream pop also had some solid songs and albums this year, with Dua Lipa’s being my
        favorite. And as has been the case for years now, rap continues to be the most exciting space in music, with
        burgeoning scenes such as Detroit and Memphis giving us something fresh and genuinely different that’s building
        the foundation upon which we’ll see the upcoming generation of rappers rise. The established stars and mainstays
        of rap also dropped a lot of music this year, most notably with Lil Baby hitting superstardom and carving out a
        space for himself in the upper echelon of today’s rappers.

        It’s been nice to have music as one of the constants in my life this year, but looking back, one of the things I
        missed most was going to concerts with friends. One of the last things I was looking forward to before
        everything went to shit was going to Coachella. I now live far from many of my closest friends and concerts were
        one of the things that brought us together. It’s such a great feeling to not only be reunited, but to be
        together once again in such a joyful space. Amongst the many things that I hope to be better next year, I hope
        we can at least get that feeling back.
