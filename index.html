      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2020</h1>

        Since quarantine started, I have found myself often dreaming about the past. People from middle school and high
        school who I haven’t spoken to in years keep reappearing in my dreams. I still haven’t really figured out
        exactly why this is happening, but it’s been pretty clear to me that I’ve been feeling more nostalgic than
        usual. I’d imagine that subconsciously, there’s something safe and comforting about falling back on the things
        that I know, and my music listening this year reflected this. I spent way more time listening to my old
        favorites than seeking out new music. With that in mind, I considered not making this list at all, but I’ve
        spent the past couple days going through my saved music from 2020 and think it’s still worth putting it
        together.

        Between hyperpop, rap, indie rock, kpop, and all the other stuff I listen to, many of my favorite artists
        dropped music this year. At least for me, Charli XCX made the definitive album of quarantine, capturing the
        range of emotions that we felt in isolation this year. Dua Lipa made one of my favorite pop albums in a while,
        with a few singles that were in heavy rotation for me throughout the year. Rap had great music from upcoming
        rappers in burgeoning scenes like Detroit and Memphis, as well as established stars and mainstays like Lil Baby,
        who hit superstardom and really solidified his identity as a rapper. Having a stream of new music that I enjoyed
        was one of the few reliable sources of happiness this year, and I’m grateful for that.
      </p>

        Listening to a lot of this new music, I really felt the loss of not being able to go to live shows. Looking
        back, going to concerts with friends was something that I really missed this year. One of the last things I was
        looking forward to before everything went to shit was going to Coachella. I now live far from many of my closest
        friends and concerts were one of the things that brought us together. It’s such a great feeling to not only be
        reunited, but also to be together once again in such a joyful space. Amongst the many things that I hope to be
        better next year, I hope we can at least get that feeling back.
